## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Adobe Photoshop

### What I learned

Without using any external libraries or frameworks, I was forced to push the limits of creativity while working purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create a visually stunning webpage that could compete with those powered by external libraries and frameworks. I methodically planned every aspect of the website's design, including the creation of the company logo.

### Continued development

I would have preferred to finish the search and filter functions, as well as have each vehicle listing have its own reservation page, given that the project's scope was purely frontend with basic functions.
